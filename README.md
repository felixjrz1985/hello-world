# hello-world

This repository now includes a simple scientific calculator web app.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a web browser. Click the buttons to build an
expression and press `=` to evaluate. Functions such as `sin`, `cos`,
`tan`, `log`, `sqrt`, and `pow` are supported as well as constants
`Ï€` and `e`.

## GitHub Pages

The repository contains a workflow at `.github/workflows/pages.yml` that deploys the app to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `master` branch. After merging this workflow, enable **GitHub Pages** in the repository settings and select **GitHub Actions** as the source. The site will then be available at `https://<your-user>.github.io/<your-repo>/` once the workflow completes.
